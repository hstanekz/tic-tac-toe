## What I Learned

During the development of this game, I aimed to demonstrate my proficiency in using various programming techniques in JavaScript, including object-oriented programming. To represent the game board and game logic, I created an object-oriented approach using factory functions and modules. The game board is represented by a 3x3 grid, which is stored as an array of arrays in the gameBoard module. The game logic is handled by the game module, which controls the state of the game and checks for wins and ties.
